  "title": "Karna's Crushing Secret: The Eldest Pandava",
  "narration": "His fingers trace the edge of the golden armor fused to his chest. Karna built his entire life on defiance. Mocked as a charioteer's son, he fought for every ounce of respect. He allied with Duryodhana just to prove he was the equal of the great Arjuna. But a single whisper from the past shatters his reality. Kunti stands before him on the riverbank, revealing a buried secret. He is her firstborn. The eldest Pandava. The men he swore to destroy are his own flesh and blood. Imagine the crushing weight of a war fought against your own family. Do you abandon the only friend who gave you a crown when the world gave you dust? Or do you strike down the brothers you were meant to protect? True dharma rarely offers an easy path. Sometimes, loyalty demands a price heavier than a crown. And so, his fingers trace the edge.",
