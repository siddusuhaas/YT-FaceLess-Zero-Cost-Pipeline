  "title": "Why You Must Let Go of the Result",
  "narration": "Your hands tremble as you fall to your knees in the dust. You stand on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, paralyzed. Warrior Arjuna sees his own family standing against him. The weight of the coming slaughter crushes his spirit. Why fight if victory feels like ash? Why act at all? Then, the chariot driver speaks over the roaring war horns. Krishna points toward the enemy lines. He does not promise victory. He does not promise a kingdom. He reveals the timeless truth. You have the right to your actions, but never to the fruits of those actions. Let go of the reward. Let go of the failure. The result is an illusion. Your only duty is to act with absolute purpose right now. When you stop staring at the horizon, the fear vanishes. You simply breathe, stand up, and prepare for what comes next, even as your hands tremble.",
