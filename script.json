  "title": "The Tragic Truth That Broke Karna",
  "narration": "Karna stares down at his trembling hands, the golden armor heavy on his chest. For a lifetime, they called you lowborn. A charioteer’s son who bled twice as much just to stand on the battlefield. You built your worth on loyalty to the one man who accepted you. Then the truth shatters your world. Kunti speaks the words. You are her firstborn. The eldest Pandava. The very brothers you swore to destroy are your own flesh and blood. The crown of the empire belongs to you by right. But what is blood when it abandoned you? Krishna smiles gently. He asks you to choose between the throne of dharma and the chains of loyalty. You realize true honor is not given by birth, nor taken by kings. It is forged in the fire of keeping your word, even when doom is certain. Even as you raise your bow, feeling the golden armor heavy on your chest.",
  "description": "Imagine finding out the enemy you swore to destroy is your own flesh and blood. The tragic, untold devastation of Karna when he learns he is the eldest Pandava.",
