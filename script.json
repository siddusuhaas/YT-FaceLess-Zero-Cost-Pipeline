"title": "The Secret to Stress-Free Success",
"narration": "Imagine standing on a battlefield, paralyzed by the weight of your own choices. This is where Arjuna stood when the universe’s greatest secret was whispered to him. You have a right to your work, but never to the fruits of it. Sounds unfair? Look deeper. When you obsess over the result, you become a slave to a future that hasn't happened yet. You lose the power of the present. Krishna isn't telling you to stop caring; he’s telling you to stop worrying. Do the work because it is yours to do. Give it your soul, your focus, your fire. But the outcome? That belongs to the cosmos. When you detach from the prize, you become unstoppable. No fear of failure can touch you. No ego of success can blind you. Perform your duty with a steady heart. The work itself is your reward. Action is your only true domain.",
